        </h1>
        <p id="p1">
            My name is Raven Wells, and I am currently majoring in Computer Science at Brigham Young University - Idaho.
          I also have a minor in Mathematics and clusters in Russian and Graphic Design. I am self-taught in R and SQL,
          and have taken a variety of online certificate courses in Data Analytics.

            I grew up the middle child of 5 children, meaning I had both the opportunity to be spoiled and to take care 
            of my younger siblings. During COVID, I spent my time watching my younger siblings, going to highschool, and 
            practicing Spanish and French. I am currently still practicing Spanish and French, and hope to soon add Mandarin 
            to my repertoire.
