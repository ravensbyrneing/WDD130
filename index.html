            <p>Heya, I'm Raven, and I am a Software Engineering major. I am also going for clusters in Russian, Spanish, and Mandarin.
                As you can probably tell, I love learning new languages, and I also enjoy playing games like Destiny 2 and Fortnite, 
                though I'm not all too good at them, and I <i>love</i> baking.
                I have four siblings, and one neice and nephew. </p>
            <p>My favorite scripture is D&C 130:18,"Whatever principle of 
                intelligence we attain unto in this life, it will rise with 
                us in the ressurection."</p>
